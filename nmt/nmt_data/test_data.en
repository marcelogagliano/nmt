A clinical investigator reported a 59-year-old Chinese male patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was hospitalized due to
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (CTC grade 3), interstitial pneumonia (CTC grade 3), and subsequently died due to unknown cause.
The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage occurred approximately one year after study therapy initiation. Study therapy was delayed due to
the event.
The patient's medical history included hypopharyngeal carcinoma resection. Concomitant medications were not reported.
On 11-Aug-2016, open-label study therapy with intravenous (IV) nivolumab (3mg/kg) was initiated. The last dose prior to the onset of
the event was on 25-Aug-2017 (27 cycles).
Tumor assessment on 22-Aug-2017 showed non-target lesions unequivocal progression and intra-cranial lesion size increasing, while
target lesion in lung remained stable (32mm).
On 25-Aug-2017, the patient presented for his next cycle (27th) of study therapy and said he had hemoptysis on 22-Aug-2017. He
had complaints of hoarseness, pharyngeal trouble, cough, and expectoration were similar to the prior event of hemoptysis. The
patient reported that he took "yun nan bai yao" for treatment.
On 30-Aug-2017, since hemoptysis was worse than the previous event, he went to the hospital.
On 03-Sep-2017, he was transferred to another hospital. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. The scan was taken to
the primary investigator and a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia was considered. On an unspecified date, the patient was treated
with methylprednisolone (240mg/day) and antibiotics.
The lung CT scan showed central lesion in the upper lobe of right lung, "double pulmonary inflammation", "double lung localized
emphysema", old lesion in right lung and mediastinal lymph node enlargement.
On 11-Sep-2017 and 13-Sep-2017, the patient underwent computerized tomography (CT) of pulmonary vasculature: no contrast
agent was found in the right brachiocephalic and superior vena cava - tumor thrombus was suspected. The thoracic aorta was
atherosclerotic; the right pulmonary hilus had a space-occupying lesion; and abnormal blood supply in the liver was noted.
Chest CT also showed that "double pneumonia" was more absorbed than on 09-Sep-2017. Old changes in right lung were noted (the
density of soft tissue in the mediastinum of upper right lobe was visible; the border was not clear; size approx. 3.3x2.8 cm with
"rough" edge). Changes in the density of the "double pulmonary membrane glass, inflammatory disease?" were also noted.
On an unspecified date, the following diagnostic tests were done: coagulation test: PT 13.8, FG 5.22 G/L. Routine blood test: WBC
10.28 x 10E9/L, hemoglobin 88 G/L, potassium 3.02 mmol/L, chloride 97.8 mmol/L. Sputum smear showed spores and "false
mycelium".
During hospitalization, the patient received daily IV infusion of methylprednisolone 240 mg from 07-Sep-2017 to 11-Sep-2017, 160
mg from 12-Sep-2017 to 19-Sep-2017, 120 mg from 20-Sep-2017 to 21-Sep-2017 and 80 mg on 22-Sep-2017. The patient also
received immunoglobulin 20 mg IV GTT QD from 07-Sep-2017 to 10-Sep-2017.
After admission, the patient was given piperacillin/tazobactam 5g BID IVGTT, "haemocoagulase agkstrodon", hypophyseal pituitrin,
carbazochrome sodium sulfonate for hemostasis. Esomeprazole 40 mg BID IVGGT and Aminophylline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate +
Methoxyphenamine Hydrochloride + Noscapine capsules TID orally for cough, and potassium chloride sustained release tablets 10 g
BID orally for potassium supplement; thymopentin injection 20 mg IM once, levocarnitine injection 3 g once for myocardial nutrition,
"Caltrated" and oral sodium capsule for supplement, a coenzyme complex for injection 200 IUM once; cyclophosphamide 0.4 IVGTT
on both 16-Sep-2017 and 17-Sep-2017.
On 21-Sep-2017, the patient stopped coughing up blood, maintained previous support and hemostasis therapy.
On 22-Sep-2017, the patient's condition has improved and he was discharged from the hospital.
On 25-Sep2017, the investigator suggested to continue the treatment. After the results of chest CT scan, the investigator decided to
the follow-up treatment.
According to the investigator, after review of the chest CT, the event was considered to be potential bilateral pneumonitis but it was
difficult to diagnose because the patient was at a local hospital with limited information. Hemoptysis was due to either tumor lesion or
pneumonitis, and it was understood that pneumonitis is not typically associated with hemoptysis.
